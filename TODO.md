# Things that Ross wants to do
## create a d3 DAG visualization to show:
  + branching
  + merging
  + commiting
  + rebasing
  + cherry-picking

1. d3 may not be the best way to do this since we'd have to spin up a completely new view and bake it ourselves

2. processing/processing.js is an option but adds complexity to our codebase
  

## make a impress.js deck to go over:
  + the basics of each object and actions
  + common workflows
  + less common workflows
  + workflow suggestions
